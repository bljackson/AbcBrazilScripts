# AbcBrazilScripts
scripts of scraping brazil abc site and pulling out recipients from title columns. Work in progress.

brazilRecipient is still a work in progress. GeograPy does not seem to properly account for country ISO codes that just happen to be in existing words.
Still need to fix that so it does not think there are countries when there are in fact not.
Also need to account for the fact that Brazil will talk about itself inside the title, and that that is not a recipient country.
